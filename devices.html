        <h3>Devices</h3>
        <p>
            As a self-taught musician I play with various <a href="gear.html">gear</a>. In 2007 I started to build my
            own instruments. <br>
            In this page you can find the hardware projects I've developed so far. I make <a

            <h4>matrix</h4>
            <p>
                matrix is a passive matrix mixer with 4 inputs and 4 outputs. <br>
                It routes multiple input signals to multiple outputs, it can be used to distribute signals to different
                effect chains and amplification systems or to control the gain of feedback loops when used in no-input
                configurations.
                <br>
                All the jacks are 3,5 mm (1/8") mono. <br>
                It does not require power supply. <br>
                matrix is available on my <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/pangrus/matrix/">Tindie store</a>.

            <h4>Texture</h4>
            <p>
                Texture is a device that incorporates three independent sound generators for the production of a wide
                variety of sonic environments with a ever changing expressive vitality. <br>
                All sound parameters can be modified through direct manipulation of the knobs allowing a direct, fast
                and
                intuitive performance. The sound generators have complementary tonal characteristic and their circuits
                can
                be
                customized easily, by changing the electronic components values that affect the frequency of the
                oscillators
                and the cut-off frequency of the passive filters. <br>
                The circuit derives directly from <a href="kinetik_laboratories.html#protean">Kinetik Laboratories'
                    Protean</a>, a powerful drone sound generator. <br>
                Texture is divided in three sections: Cluster, Ring and Chaos. <br>
                Cluster is composed by three frequency controlled oscillators. It allows the creation of eternally
                sustained
                chords and clusters of microtonal intervals. <br>
                In the Ring section the signal from the center oscillator is processed by two pseudo-ring modulation
                circuits with the other two oscillators. Adjustments of the oscillator pitches result in evocative and
                constantly changing
                Textures, bell-like or otherwise metallic sounds. <br>
                Chaos is formed by three oscillators in cross-modulation. Its sonic character far exceeds the typical
                white and pink noise sources. Tuning the oscillator pitches allows timbral metamorphosis and complex
                variations in
                tone and sound granularity. <br>
                Each section has a level knob to mix the three voices. <br>
                The circuit is powered on a 2.1mm barrel jack, center negative, like your favourite pedal effect. <br>

            <h4>multi</h4>
            <p>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/multi"> multi</a> is an open hardware circuit board
                hosting a powerful Seeeduino XIAO, 6 pots, 2 pushbuttons, 2 Midi DIN connectors and an audio output.
                <br>
                The Seeeduino XIAO board carries the powerful ATSAMD21G18A-MU which is a low-power microcontroller and
                has
                14 GPIO PINs, a DAC output and one UART interface. <br>
                The strong point is that you can program your multi as you need, using the Arduino IDE. <br>
                On the MIDI side, possible use includes advanced midi controlling, filtering and remapping as well as
                algorithmic arpeggiators and aleatoric patch generators. It's also perfect to explore digital synthesis
                techniques. <br>
                <br>
                DIY kits and assembled units are available on my <a
                    href="https://www.tindie.com/products/pangrus/multi-kit-or-fully-assembled/">Tindie store</a>.

            <h4>bebe</h4>
            <p>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/bebe"> bebe</a> is a two oscillators sound generator
                with a 5 steps gate sequencer/LFO. Sound generation comes from a 4093 CMOS chip and the sequencer is
                implemented on an
                ATtiny84 MCU. It's eurorack compatible, the two oscillators have CV/GATE inputs and the sequencer
                generate a
                clock out (hackable as clock in) and two gate outputs.

            <p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/bpd"> bpd (borderline personality disorder)</a> is a
            three cross modulated oscillators voice for eurorack systems. The sound palette of this circuit is wide,
            it
            can produce
            throbbling basses as well as white noise. The circuit was originally implemented for the harsh side of
            Dr.Jekyll & Mr.Hide. BPD has also a CV input that influences the timbre and the sound dynamic.

            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/HSE-Hidden_Sound_Explorer"> hse (hidden sound
                explorer)</a> is a circuit that allows to amplify small voltages coming from piezo-electric
            transducers
            or from coils. It
            allows to scope out the electromagnetic fields produced by power supplies, electric motors,
            smartphones...whatever. Any electromagnetic source will produce a distinct sound.
