		<h2>As a self-taught musician I play with various <a href="gear.html">gear</a>. In 2007 I started to build my own instruments.
            <br>In this page you can find the hardware projects I've developed so far. I make <a href="workshops.html">workshops</a>, teaching people how to build and use them.

		<h3><b>texture</b> is a device that incorporates three independent sound generators for the production of a wide variety of sonic environments with a ever changing expressive vitality. All sound parameters can be modified through direct manipulation of the knobs allowing a direct, fast and intuitive performance.
            <br> The sound generators have complementary tonal characteristic and their circuits can be customized easily, by changing the electronic components values that affect the frequency of the oscillators and the cut-off frequency of the passive filters. 
            <br> The circuit derives directly from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.peal.space/kinetik_laboratories.html#protean">Kinetik Laboratories' Protean</a>, a powerful drone sound generator.

                multi</a> is an open hardware circuit board hosting a powerful Seeeduino XIAO, 6 pots, 2 pushbuttons, 2 Midi DIN connectors and an audio output.
		<br>The Seeeduino XIAO board carries the powerful ATSAMD21G18A-MU which is a low-power microcontroller and has 14 GPIO PINs, a DAC output and one UART interface. 
		<br>The strong point is that you can program your multi as you need, using the Arduino IDE. 
		<br>On the MIDI side, possible use includes advanced midi controlling, filtering and remapping as well as algorhitmic arpeggiators and aleatoric patch generators. It's also perfect to explore digital synthesis techniques.<br>
DIY kits and assembled units are available on my <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/pangrus/multi-kit-or-fully-assembled/">Tindie store</a>.

            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/bebe">
                bebe</a> is a two oscillators sound generator with a 5 steps gate sequencer/LFO. Sound generation comes from a 4093 CMOS chip and the sequencer is implemented on an ATtiny84 MCU. It's eurorack compatible, the two oscillators have CV/GATE inputs and the sequencer generate a clock out (hackable as clock in) and two gate outputs.

                bpd (borderline personality disorder)</a> is a three cross modulated oscillators voice for eurorack systems. The sound palette of this circuit is wide, it can produce throbbling basses as well as white noise. The circuit was originally implemented for the harsh side of Dr.Jekyll & Mr.Hide. BPD has also a CV input that influences the timbre and the sound dynamic.

                hse (hidden sound explorer)</a> is a circuit that allows to amplify small voltages coming from piezo-electric transducers or from coils. It allows to scope out the electromagnetic fields produced by power supplies, electric motors, smartphones...whatever. Any electromagnetic source will produce a distinct sound.
