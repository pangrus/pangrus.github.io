        <h3>Kinetik Laboratories</h3>
        From 2008 to 2019 I collaborated with Claudio Granzieri in a project that involved the construction of special
        sound machines. <br />
        The sound generators we have designed and built can be described as drone/noise boxes. <br />
        Our research was oriented to recreate the sounds heard in the soundtracks of science fiction films of the
        fifties and sixties. At the same time we were looking for new timbres that could represent the randomness of
        nature, its mutability and harshness.

            <h4>Mot-Box</h4>
            <p>
                Mot-Box is a sound generator, with four audio oscillators, two lfos and two 1/4" jack inputs, available
                to connect external analog gear.<br />
                All in a rugged box, with cherry wood side plates. It produces sounds varying from drones to
                helter-skelter noises.

            <p>
                The Harsh Noise Generator is the ideal sound source for your effect chain and is an open hardware
                project!

            <h4>Dr.Jekyll & Mr.Hyde</h4>
            <p>
                Dr.Jekyll & Mr.Hyde is formed by two distinct mixable circuit voices, the Jekyll's one is warm, firm and
                comforting, the other is harsh, noisy and sometimes unpredictable: the Hyde side. Each voice has three
                oscillators with respecting FREQUENCY control.

            <h4>Gort-the Robot</h4>
            <p>
                Gort-the Robot is constituted by four frequency controlled oscillators, combined through pseudo ring
                modulator circuits.
                The square wave oscillators can run freely (Stop Mode) or alternatively gated by the 16 steps internal
                sequencer (Activate Mode). In the latter case each step generates different oscillators combinations and
                therefore
                different sounds, varying in tone and timbre.

            <h4>Xmatrix</h4>
            <p>
                Xmatrix is a passive matrix mixer with 3 inputs and 3 outputs. It can be used to distribute signals to
                different effect chains and amplification systems or to control the gain of feedback loops when used in
                no-input configurations. Xmatrix routes multiple input signals to multiple outputs, allowing different
                mixes from a common set of signals.

            <h4>ILL-LOGIC</h4>
            <p>
                ILL-LOGIC is a stand alone compact system with semi-modular structure. It can be used to generate
                complex sound textures. Using 4mm banana plugs it offers great functional flexibility and small
                footprint. It has 12 knobs, 22 connection points, two switches and a red led that reflects the behavior
                of the noise generator. The input plugs accept any output allowing you to experience the most of its
                sonic potential.

            <h4>Morphing Noise</h4>
            <p>
                Morphing Noise combines a noise source sound generator and a modulator circuit. The NOISE SOURCE circuit
                is formed by three oscillators modulating each other and generates similar sounds to those obtainable
                with cross-modulation technique. Its sonic character far exceeds the typical white or pink noise
                sources.

            <h4 id="protean">Protean</h4>
            <p>
                The PROTEAN Motion Texture Source is a compact device that incorporates three independent sound
                generators for the production of a wide variety of sonic environments with a ever changing expressive
                vitality.
                <br />
                All sound parameters can be modified through direct manipulation of the knobs allowing a direct, fast
                and intuitive performance. <br />
                The sound generators have complementary timbral characteristic covering all the frequency spectrum and
                may also be modulated by the two low frequency oscillators implemented in the circuit, generating
                hypnotic sounds which evolve over time. <br />
                Protean has three independent outputs, each with its own output level to allow further manipulation
                using external effects and may also be used in mono mode when in the needs of a reduced setup. The
                project has been released as open hardware in 2020.

            <h4>Dao</h4>
            <p>
                Dao is a pattern controlled slicer capable of turning every signal connected to the INPUT JACK into a
                rhythmic sequence, passing or muting it towards the OUTPUT JACK. The rhythm patterns are based on the
                position of two knobs, PATTERN LENGTH and CHOP NUMBER, allowing an intuitive use of the device. Dao
                rhythm patterns are generated using the euclidean algorithm.
