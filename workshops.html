            The workshops are aimed at musicians, artists, sound designers, sound engineers and anyone looking for unusual sounds.
            <br> They are the opportunity to approach the self-construction of one's own electronic musical instruments, learn to recognize electronic components and learn the technique of tin soldering.
            <br> No specific knowledge is required.

        <h5><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/bebe">
                Bebe</a> - is a two oscillators sound generator with a 5 steps gate sequencer/LFO. Sound generation comes from a 4093 CMOS chip and the sequencer is implemented on an ATtiny84 MCU. It's eurorack compatible, the two oscillators have CV/GATE inputs and the sequencer generate a clock out (hackable as clock in) and two gate outputs.
                <br>
                This workshop has been committed by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.conservatorio.ch/it">Conservatorio della Svizzera italiana</a>. The name is a tribute to Bebe Barron, pioneer in the field of electronic music.

        <h5><a href='https://github.com/pangrus/HSE-Hidden_Sound_Explorer'>Hidden Sound Explorer</a> is a circuit that transduces the electromagnetic fields, produced by the electronic devices that surround us, into sounds to be listened through earphones. It amplifies the electrical signal of a coil connected to the input, a two-pole connector.
            <br> A piezoelectric disc (contact microphone) can also be connected to the input terminals to explore the world of micro-sounds that are normally inaudible.

        <h5>Burn-ya - It is an old habit of electronic makers to use a jar to contain electronic circuits.
            <br> In this workshop an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/ATtiny_Multiboard">ATtiny multiboard</a> is used to build a programmable sound generator based on the algorithmic generation technique known as bytebeat.

        <h5>Contact microphone - A piezoelectric transducer can be used as a contact microphone. It works by being in direct contact with an object. The mechanical vibrations that affect the object are converted to electrical signal that can be amplified though a power amplifier.
            <br> This workshop can be considered an introduction to the tin soldering technique in which the participants build their own contact microphone.
