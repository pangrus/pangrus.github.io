        <h3>Workshops</h3>
        The workshops are aimed at musicians, artists, sound designers, sound engineers and anyone looking for unusual
        sounds.<br>
        They are the opportunity to approach the self-construction of one's own electronic musical instruments, learn to
        recognize electronic components and learn the technique of tin soldering.<br>
        No specific knowledge is required.<br>
        If you are interested in organizing a workshop, do not hesitate to contact me.

            <h4>Bebe</h4>
            <p>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/bebe"> Bebe</a> is a two oscillators sound generator
                with a
                5 steps gate sequencer/LFO. Sound generation comes from a 4093 CMOS chip and the sequencer is
                implemented on
                an ATtiny84 MCU. It's eurorack compatible, the two oscillators have CV/GATE inputs and the sequencer
                generate a
                clock out (hackable as clock in) and two gate outputs. <br>
                This workshop has been committed by the <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.conservatorio.ch/it">Conservatorio
                    della Svizzera italiana</a>. The name is a tribute to Bebe Barron, pioneer in the field of
                electronic
                music.

            <h4>Hidden Sound Explorer</h4>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/pangrus/HSE-Hidden_Sound_Explorer">Hidden Sound Explorer</a> is a circuit
                that
                transduces the electromagnetic fields, produced by the electronic devices that surround us, into sounds
                to
                be
                listened through earphones. It amplifies the electrical signal of a coil connected to the input, a
                two-pole
                connector. <br>
                A piezoelectric disc (contact microphone) can also be connected to the input terminals to explore the
                world
                of
                micro-sounds that are normally inaudible.

            <h4>Burn-ya</h4>
            <p>
                It's an old habit of electronic makers to use a jar to contain electronic circuits. <br>
                In this workshop an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pangrus/ATtiny_Multiboard">ATtiny
                    multiboard</a>
                is used to build a programmable sound generator based on the algorithmic generation technique known as
                bytebeat.

            <h4>Contact microphone</h4>
            <p>
                A piezoelectric transducer can be used as a contact microphone. It works by being in direct contact with
                an
                object. The mechanical vibrations that affect the object are converted to electrical signal
                that can be amplified though a power amplifier. <br>
                This workshop can be considered an introduction to the tin soldering technique in which the participants
                build
                their own contact microphone.
